# Discord Bot
 
 # How to create a discord bot:
 
 I used the discord.py Python library to write the code for the bot. discord.py is an API wrapper for Discord that makes it easier to create a Discord bot in Python. The code is being run on repl.it as it is an online IDE that you can use on your web browser and doesn't require hosting.
 
 # Discord Events:
 
 discord.py revolves around the concept of events. An event is something you listen to and then respond to. For example, when a message happens, you will receive an event about it that you can respond to.
 
 This bot will respond with a message of encouragement whenever someone sends a message containing a sad or depressing word.

Anyone will be able to add encouraging messages for the bot to use and the user-submitted messages will be stored in the Repl.it database.

The bot will also return a random inspirational quote from an API when someone types the message "$inspire" into the chat.
